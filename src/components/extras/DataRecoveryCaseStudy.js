        <section>
          <h2>üåü Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            One random day, a TikTok video explaining how "deleted" or even "permanently deleted" files can often be
            recovered piqued my curiosity. It showcased the seemingly magical ability of forensic experts to retrieve
            lost data, raising questions like:{' '}
            <strong>What happens when a file is deleted? Is it truly gone, or just hidden in plain sight?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This moment of intrigue spiraled into a mission‚Äîa personal endeavor to uncover the science behind data
            recovery. I embarked on a journey to demystify the processes involved and develop my own data recovery tool
            capable of restoring files from corrupted or deleted storage.

        {/* Objective */}
        <section>
          <h2>üéØ Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The goal was clear: <strong>To design a professional-grade data recovery tool</strong> that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Recovers deleted or inaccessible files.</li>
            <li>Handles corrupted storage devices.</li>
            <li>Supports various file formats, including images, text, and videos.</li>
            <li>Provides users with an intuitive graphical interface.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* Data Recovery Process */}
        <section>
          <h2>üîç The Data Recovery Process</h2>
          <p>The project was structured into the following stages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Research:</strong> Studied file systems (FAT32, NTFS, APFS) and how deleted files are managed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tool Design:</strong> Created components for file scanning, recovery, and a user-friendly GUI.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Implementation:</strong> Developed the tool using Python, PyQt5 for the UI, and `pytsk3` for disk
              analysis.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* Challenges */}
        <section>
          <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Learnings</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Permission Issues:</strong> Reading raw disk data required administrative access. I solved this by
              integrating
              <code>sudo</code> commands and adjusting permissions dynamically.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hardware Compatibility:</strong> Different storage devices and file systems posed challenges. I
              extensively tested the tool on various storage formats, including USB drives, SD cards, and external hard
              disks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>PyQt5 Configuration:</strong> Ensuring the GUI worked seamlessly on macOS required careful
              dependency management. I leveraged Homebrew and virtual environments to handle package installations
              smoothly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safe Testing:</strong> Since the tool interacts directly with storage devices, I had to take
              <strong>extra precautions to avoid modifying critical system disks</strong>. I ensured that I only
              performed read operations on system drives and thoroughly tested the recovery process on{' '}
              <strong>non-essential external drives</strong> before working with real-world cases.
            </li>
            {/* <li>
              <strong>Optimizing Performance:</strong> The tool had to efficiently scan large storage devices without
              excessive memory usage. I optimized the scanning logic to minimize unnecessary re-renders and keep DOM
              updates lightweight.
